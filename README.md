# Molecular_Dynamics

This project focuses on simulating 500 particles in a box interacting under a Lennard-Jones potential. It begins with MATLAB for coding and visual simulation, followed by converting the code to C++. However, the OpenGL-based visual simulation for the C++ implementation is still pending. Additionally, the simulation results are currently inaccurate, with significant fluctuations observed in the plotted graphs.
